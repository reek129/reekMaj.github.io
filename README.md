Data preprocessing:
1. For generating data for Line graph from json files to csv of spain and england match events.

https://github.com/reek129/reekMajumder/blob/main/data_preprocessing/spain%20league%20DataPrep.ipynb
2. For generating a flat csv from match events of england and spain json files. This is for network graph.
